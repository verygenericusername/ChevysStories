It has been two years since water and water have exploded. Pineapple and Pineapple heard about the story of water and water and Pineapple 1 thought he should make a reviving machine. Pineapple looked online on how to make one. Pineapple saw something probably reliable. Pineapple clicked on the website. The steps were: “Step 1: Buy a microwave oven. Step 2: Buy a button. Step 3: Buy a RPCIV (RevivePersonChipIV) capacitor. Step 4: Install the button to the RPCIV capacitor, and use soulder to do so. Step 5: Plug in the microwave oven to an outlet.  Step 6: Get DNA or something that the person had. Step 7: Press the button. Step 8: Watch the person get revived!". Pineapple got everything he needed, a microwave oven, RPCIV capacitor, and a button. Pineapple installed the button to the RPCIV Capacitor and installed everything to the microwave oven. Pineapple proceeded to plug in the microwave oven. But pineapple realized, that he didnt have any pieces or DNA of water! Pineapple sneakily went to the person’s house while the person was sleeping. Pineapple went to the person’s basement and found a piece of water. It was a piece of glass! Pineapple took the piece back home to the microwave oven. Pineapple Placed the piece in the microwave oven and pressed the button. Lots of noise started happening, it lasted around 7 seconds. Then the microwave oven beeped. Pineapple opened the door, and lots of smoke came out. Two waters came out of the oven. Pineapple was confused. It turns out the waters were twins! They had the same DNA and Water Type! They were both back alive 2 years later! Pineapple told them both the story. Pineapple said to both waters: “You guys have been exploded by a person. We dont know who he is, but we all ended up on his table.”, Water 1 replied: "Yes that is true.", Pineapple said: "Us, pineapple and pineapple almost got exploded too, but we escaped, but only me. Its a very long story.", Water replied: "You should tell me this story sometime.", Pineapple said: “Yeah, i should. Well, you guys exploded, 2 YEARS AGO.", Water said: "What?!?! Really???" Pineapple replied saying: "Yes, really. We revived you in this modded microwave oven. Well let’s talk tomorrow. We have to go somewhere. It was nice talking to you two.", Water said: "Same here. Well talk to you later then." Pineapple and Water both said bye. Pineapple and Water became friends. Water and water lived their lives on, and stayed away from the person’s house as much as possible.
